In order to install rdchord, take the following steps.
You should either be logged in as root, or precede each of the commands with sudo.

$ make
$ make install

In order to use rdchord and the rdkit.* functions, you must have the rdkit/python scripting language installed.
There is documentation about how to do this at http://rdkit.org/
There may also be synatpics packages (Ubuntu/Debian) or rpm packages (Redhat/CentOS/Fedora/SuSE) to make rdkit installation easier.

Then install rdchord:
$ python setup.py install

Add the following lines  to the postgresql environemnt to postgresql aware of the location of rdkit
This environment file may be in another location on your servers, depending the
version of postgres, the type of operating system or the linux distribution you are using.
Futher, the values for PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH will sutely be different,
depending on where you installed rdkit.
For example:
$ cat >> /etc/postgresql/9.2/main/environment
PYTHONPATH =  '/home/tj/RDKit/rdkit-code'
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = '/home/tj/RDKit/rdkit-code/lib'
^D

Next, install the rdkit.* SQL functions into a (new) database (e.g. rdchord)
You must also have the plpythonu language available in your installed postgres.
There are synaptics and rpm packages for this,
or if you compile postgres yourself, use the --with-python option.
$ createdb rdchord
will create a database called rdchord.
You can install the functions into an existing database (rdchord).
You must have administrator privilege for the postgres database.
$ bash installdb rdchord
If the above does not work, login as a user with postgres administrator privilege or do something like this.
$ sudo -u postgres bash installdb rdchord

Now, you should be able to connect to rdchord or rdchord and do something like:
$ psql rdchord
 select rdkit.cansmiles(rdkit.rdmol('c1ccccc1C(=O)NC'));
and get the result
  rdchord=#  select rdkit.cansmiles(rdkit.rdmol('c1ccccc1C(=O)NC'));
     cansmiles    
 -----------------
  CNC(=O)c1ccccc1
 (1 row)
